# **FINAL APA PROJECT**

 
## *Predicting students grades*

### Introduction

In this project, we are going to study the correlation between demographic attributes and their relationship with academic performance. The dataset we've chosen is formed by attributes that a priori are interrelated with the academic performance of secondary school students. This includes the level of education of their parents, their parent's job and other similar attributes. The dataset allows us to treat it as a regression problem or through classification problem. In summary, the dataset has $33$ attributes (some numerical and some categorical) and a total of $395$ samples.


The dataset was extracted from the $\texttt{UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository}$, it is a collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators that are used by the machine learning community for the empirical analysis of machine learning algorithms. It was originated by *David Aha* and fellow graduates from $\texttt{UC Irvine}$.


The full dataset can be obtained from [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/student+performance) , this includes the **.csv** files and other descriptive documents about the dataset. Regarding the source of this dataset, we know that it was collected through school reports and questionnaires from a Portuguese school (in *Cortez \& Silva*, *2008*).
